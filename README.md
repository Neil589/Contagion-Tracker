# Contagion-Tracker
This project is inspired by the Washington Postâ€™s article (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) that simulated infectiousness with 2D cells in a graphical visualization. 
This simulation helps visualise the effects of COVID-19 and how it spreads between people, how quarantining effects this spread and also how vaccinations can alter the rate of the spread.
Created using Python for Comp 110
